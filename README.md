# CODESAGE – AI Interview Management Platform

## Architecture Overview
CODESAGE is a **modular, cloud-native platform** designed to conduct bias-free interviews at scale. The architecture ensures **scalability, reliability, and real-time performance** while maintaining candidate privacy. The system consists of multiple layers: Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, Storage, Integration, and Security.

---

## 1. Frontend Layer
**Purpose:** Provides the interface for interviewers and candidates.

**Technologies:**
- Web: React.js / Next.js
- Mobile (optional): React Native / Flutter
- Styling: Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI
- Animations: Framer Motion

**Features:**
- Candidate onboarding & anonymization
- Interview setup (technical / resume-based)
- Live dashboards & analytics

---

## 2. Backend Layer
**Purpose:** Manages business logic, interviews, analytics, and reporting.

**Technologies:**
- Node.js / Express.js (REST API)
- Python / FastAPI (AI model serving)
- GraphQL (optional) for optimized data fetching

**Features:**
- Scheduling & interview session management
- Candidate and recruiter management
- Real-time data updates for dashboards

---

## 3. AI/ML Layer
**Purpose:** Powers adaptive interviews and analytics.

**Technologies & Models:**
- NLP models (Hugging Face, OpenAI API) for question generation & response analysis
- ML models for performance scoring & insights
- Recommendation engines for adaptive questioning

**Features:**
- Dynamic, AI-driven interviews
- Real-time hints & feedback
- Detailed candidate performance analytics

---

## 4. Storage & Database Layer
**Purpose:** Stores candidate data, session logs, reports, and analytics.

**Technologies:**
- PostgreSQL / MySQL – Structured data
- MongoDB – Session logs & semi-structured analytics
- Firebase / AWS S3 – Reports, recordings, and files
- Redis – Real-time caching & session management

**Features:**
- Anonymized candidate storage (no PII)
- Efficient retrieval for dashboards and reports
- Secure session recording storage

---

## 5. Integration Layer
**Purpose:** Connects CODESAGE with external systems.

**Technologies:** REST APIs, Webhooks

**Integrations:**
- ATS / HR platforms
- Coding platforms & assessment tools
- Video/audio streaming via WebRTC (optional)

---

## 6. Security Layer
**Purpose:** Protects candidate and recruiter data.

**Technologies & Methods:**
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT for authentication
- HTTPS / TLS for secure communication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Candidate anonymization using UUIDs

---

## 7. DevOps & Deployment
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for microservices
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab pipelines
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS / GCP / Azure
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling microservices for large hiring drives

---

## 8. Data Flow Overview
1. Interviewer sets up interview → Backend API records configuration
2. Candidate joins → AI Interview Agent initiates session
3. Questions are dynamically generated & responses recorded
4. Analytics microservice calculates performance metrics in real-time
5. Reports & dashboards generated for recruiters, without storing personal identifiers

---

## 9. Future Enhancements
- AI proctoring & cheating detection
- Soft-skills evaluation via NLP & voice analysis
- Multi-language support for regional/global candidates
- Blockchain-based immutable session storage
- Integration with digital credentials & verifiable certificates
