      "candidate": "Nice to meet you. Can you ask me a coding question?",
      "evaluation": "The candidate seems enthusiastic, but let's focus on their resume first.",
      "next_question": "Let's start with your education background. You're currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technological University for Women. Can you tell me about your favorite subject or project from your coursework so far?",
      "hint": null,
      "final_feedback": null
    },
    {
      "candidate": "structures and algorithms.",
      "evaluation": "The candidate has shown interest in data structures and algorithms, which is a fundamental aspect of computer science. However, I'd like to delve deeper into their understanding of these concepts.",
      "next_question": "That's great! Data structures and algorithms are crucial in computer science. Can you walk me through a project or assignment where you had to apply data structures and algorithms to solve a problem? Perhaps something from your 'Introduction to Data Science' or 'Data Structures' course?",
      "hint": null,
      "final_feedback": null
    },
    {
      "candidate": "[Code Submission]\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\ncout<<\"Hello world\"<<endl;\n}",
      "evaluation": "The candidate has provided a simple C++ program that prints 'Hello world' to the console. However, this doesn't demonstrate their understanding of data structures and algorithms. It seems they might have misunderstood the question or are trying to provide a basic example.",
      "next_question": "I was looking for a more complex example that showcases your understanding of data structures and algorithms. Let's try again. Can you explain how you would approach a problem that requires the use of a specific data structure, such as a stack or a queue, to solve it? Perhaps you can give an example from one of your projects, like the 'Movie recommender system' or 'SafeDrive'?",
